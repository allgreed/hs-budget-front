### Rule nr 1

> His palms are spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti       
> There's vomit on his spaghetti already: mom's spaghetti   
> He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti      
> To drop spaghetti, but he keeps on spaghetti      

Don't do that...

### Rule nr 2

### TODO:

Important:
- Make the main vue instance take a JS object to render that shit -> Allgreed on it
- Add dynamic canvas size to make that shit responsive as hell (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1664785/resize-html5-canvas-to-fit-window)

Devops / maintanance:

- Clean unused dev dependencies from npm
- Remove bootstrap classes from styles and work directly on it's mixins

Style:
- Add a stinkin' favicon
