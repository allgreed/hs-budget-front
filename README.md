### Rule nr 1

> His palms are spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti       
> There's vomit on his spaghetti already: mom's spaghetti   
> He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti      
> To drop spaghetti, but he keeps on spaghetti      

Don't do that...

### Rule nr 2

### TODO:

Important:

Style:
